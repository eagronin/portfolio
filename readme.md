# Introduction

The projects in this portfolio are organized by phase of the project’s development process (i.e., data acquisition, cleaning, analysis and reporting) as summarized in the diagram below:

![](https://github.com/eagronin/portfolio/blob/master/project-development-process.png?raw=true)

The projects apply R, Python, Spark and various query tools within a data science context to provide value in targeted marketing, detection of credit card fraud, investment in real estate and fire prevention using k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forest, support vector machine, linear regression, logistic regression, regularization, k-means clustering and principal component analysis.

The projects are summarized in the table below. You can click either on the project name to be directed to the project, or on any of the “x”-s in the columns on the right to be directed to the respective phase of the project’s development process.
