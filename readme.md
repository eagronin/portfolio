# Introduction

This data science project portfolio is composed of projects covering the full spectrum of the data science development process except for deployment. 

The projects apply Python and Spark within a data science context to provide value in the detection of credit card fraud, investment in real estate and fire prevention using k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forest, support vector machine, linear regression, logistic regression, regularization, k-means clustering and principal component analysis. 

The projects in this portfolio are organized by phase of the data science development process as shown in the diagram below.
