Eugene Agronin is a data scientist with a background in Economics, Finance and Statistics and over 10 years of experience in solving problems in the Hi-tech, Auto, Oil & Gas, Mining, Financial Services, Banking, Insurance, Real Estate, Gaming, Dairy and Soft Beverage industries.

Specifically, Eugene uses Python, R, SQL and NoSQL to solve problems and generate insight using regression, classification, clustering, association analysis, collaborative filtering, matrix factorization and anomaly detection. 

This data science project portfolio is composed of 21 projects covering the full spectrum of the data science process. 

This portfolio’s projects apply Python, R, SQL, Spark, Hive, MongoDB and Neo4j within a data science context to provide value to credit card fraud detection, movie and restaurant recommendation, consumer marketing, blight ticket compliance, real estate, classification of tumors, renewable energy, sports, atmospheric science, gaming and social network lines of business using KNN, decision trees, random forest, SVM, linear regression, logistic regression, regularization, K-Means clustering, PCA, association analysis, collaborative filtering, matrix factorization and anomaly detection. 

The projects in this portfolio are organized by the data science process, which includes the following steps:

1.	Data acquisition (identify data sets, retrieve / query data)
2.	Data preparation (clean, integrate, package, understand nature of the data, preliminary analysis)
3.	Analysis (select analytical techniques, build models)
4.	Reporting (communicate results)


## Data Acquisition
[Using python to acquire housing and macroeconomic data with the purpose of generating insight into investing in real estate.](https://eagronin.github.io/university-towns-acquire/)

Extract and load data on Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”), housing prices by city, and whether the city is a university town or not for further processing using python.

## Data Preparation
[Using python to clean and process housing and macroeconomic data with the purpose of generating insight into investing in real estate.](https://eagronin.github.io/university-towns-prepare/)

Clean and preprocess the data on GDP, housing prices and whether the city is a university town or not using regular expressions, reorganization and filtering; merge the three datasets to prepare the data for the analysis of real estate trends.

## Analysis
[Using python to clean and process housing and macroeconomic data with the purpose of generating insight into investing in real estate.](https://eagronin.github.io/university-towns-analyze/)

Test the hypothesis whether university towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions using a means comparison t-test of the trends in housing prices in university towns and non-university towns between the beginning and the bottom of a recession (as defined by GDP growth), to analyze trends in housing prices and generate insight into investing in real estate.
