Eugene Agronin is a data scientist with a background in Economics, Finance and Statistics and over 10 years of experience in solving problems in the Hi-tech, Auto, Oil & Gas, Mining, Financial Services, Banking, Insurance, Real Estate, Gaming, Dairy and Soft Beverage industries.

Specifically, Eugene uses Python, R, SQL and NoSQL to solve problems and generate insight using regression, classification, clustering, association analysis, collaborative filtering, matrix factorization and anomaly detection. 

This data science project portfolio is composed of 21 projects covering the full spectrum of the data science process. 

This portfolioâ€™s projects apply Python, R, SQL, Spark, Hive, MongoDB and Neo4j within a data science context to provide value to credit card fraud detection, movie and restaurant recommendation, consumer marketing, blight ticket compliance, real estate, classification of tumors, renewable energy, sports, atmospheric science, gaming and social network lines of business using KNN, decision trees, random forest, SVM, linear regression, logistic regression, regularization, K-Means clustering, PCA, association analysis, collaborative filtering, matrix factorization and anomaly detection. 

The projects in this portfolio are organized by the phases of the data science process as shown in the diagram below:
