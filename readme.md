Eugene Agronin is a data scientist with a background in Economics, Finance and Statistics and over 10 years of experience in solving problems in the Hi-tech, Auto, Oil & Gas, Mining, Financial Services, Banking, Insurance, Real Estate, Gaming, Dairy and Soft Beverage industries.

Specifically, Eugene uses Python, R, SQL and NoSQL to solve problems and generate insight using regression, classification, clustering, association analysis, collaborative filtering, matrix factorization and anomaly detection. 

This data science project portfolio is composed of 21 projects covering the full spectrum of the data science process. 

This portfolioâ€™s projects apply Python, R, SQL, Spark, Hive, MongoDB and Neo4j within a data science context to provide value to credit card fraud detection, movie and restaurant recommendation, consumer marketing, blight ticket compliance, real estate, classification of tumors, renewable energy, sports, atmospheric science, gaming and social network lines of business using KNN, decision trees, random forest, SVM, linear regression, logistic regression, regularization, K-Means clustering, PCA, association analysis, collaborative filtering, matrix factorization and anomaly detection. 

The projects in this portfolio are organized by the phases of the data science process as shown in the diagram below:

## Projects

| No. | Project Name | Description | Tools | Acquire | Prepare | Analyze | Report | Act |
| --- | ---| --- | --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|[1] | Credit Card Fraud Detection and Model Evaluation | Optimize the trade-off between recall and precision in predicting fraud in credit card transactions. | Python (SciKit Learn, Matplotlib) | x | x | x | x | - |
|[2] | Classification of Mushrooms | Select the most accurate technique for classifying mushrooms into edible and not edible by appllying several classifiers to a feature space reduced to two principal components and visualize the decision boundary. | Python (SciKit Learn, Matplotlib) | x | x | x | x | - | 
|[3] | Are Housing Prices in University Towns Less Affected by Recessions? | Generate insight into investing in real estate by testing the hypothesis whether university towns have their housing prices less effected by recessions (using a means comparison t-test). | Python (Pandas) | x | x | x | - | - | 
|[4] | Weather Patterns in Silicon Valley | Analyze weather patterns in Silicon Valley to determine if the range of temperatures has widened in 2015 as compared to the previous 10-year period (from 2005 to 2014). | Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) | x | x | x | x | - | 
|[6] | Identification of Weather Patterns in San Diego, CA Using Cluster Analysis | Identify distinct weather patterns using k-means clustering for the optimal number of clusters in the data collected from a weather station and compare cluster centers visualized using parallel coordinates plots. | Spark (pyspark SQL, ML, MLlib) | x | x | x | x | - | 
|[5] | Classification of Low Humidity Days in San Diego, CA | Determine the likelihood of wildfires by predicting low humidity days using a decision tree for providing a timely warning to the residents and appropriate authorities. | Spark (pyspark SQL, ML, MLlib) | x | x | x | - | - | 
|[7] | Streaming Weather Data Analysis | Connect to a weather station that transmits streaming data generated by sensors, process these data in real time, and save the transformed output. | Spark (pyspark Streaming) | x | - | - | - | - |
